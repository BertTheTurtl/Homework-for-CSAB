#Computer Science AB Labs
These are all of my Computer Science AB labs and you **MUST** ask my permission before using them. 
##File IO
I don't know why I was taught to read files this way. This is a far 
better method 
```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path; 
import java.util.List;

class Example
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
    {
        List<String> file = Files.readAllLines(Path.of("test.txt"));
```
##Linked Lists
A pain to learn, definitely my best test so far. The labs really helped to prepare me for it.
##Maze Lab
A major pain in my ~~butt~~ (thought you would catch me swearing, didn't you?). Got a lot of help with this, it took me 
forever and a half.
##Word Files
Just ignore these unless you find them to be useful. They are simple recursion and exception worksheets, and they are 
probably blank lol.
